# Documentation Workflow for a Rails App

This repository demonstrates a simple documentation workflow for a Rails app. It contains a basic Rails blog and a Jekyll docs site (located in `/docs`). The Jekyll site also contains a series of pages generated by YARD (located in `/docs/dev`).

The docs site is currently hosted as a [Netlify app](https://sharp-williams-b46857.netlify.app/).

To use this workflow, copy these files into your own project and customize them as needed:

* `.mldrc` and `.mld.rb`: Rules for the [markdownlint action](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint).
* `.vale.ini`: Styles used by the [Vale action](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action).
* `.github/styles/vocab.txt`: A list of words for Vale to ignore (e.g., your company name).
* `.github/workflows/docs.yml`: Workflow that configures and runs the Vale and markdownlint actions on Markdown files.
* `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`: Sample pull request template with checklists for authors, reviewers, and maintainers. This is intended for docs-only repositories.

In addition, set up the following tools:
* Install [`project-bot`](https://github.com/apps/project-bot).
* Create a GitHub Project with an automated Kanban workflow. Add columns as needed and automate them using [`project-bot`](https://github.com/apps/project-bot). See an example at **Projects** > **Docs Board**.
